# Chat (frontend)
This is the frontend of my chat application, which one allows
users to exchange the messages. This app was developed
mainly with Angular.js/socket-io/webpack/es6 with the purpose of
improvement of my frontend development skills.
The whole process of development is based on this
[workflow](https://github.com/preboot/angular-webpack).
